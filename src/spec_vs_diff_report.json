  "summary": "The diff shows a partial reversion toward Version 17, with several components modified (AlertHistory, DiseaseClassification, GovernmentDataPanel, RiskPredictionPanel, DashboardPage, backend/main.mo) and supporting files updated. However, critical evidence is limited due to truncation. Key observations: AlertHistory retains 13 columns (Version 17 requires specific columns without 'Confidence'); DiseaseClassification shows 4 diseases as required; GovernmentDataPanel and RiskPredictionPanel claim correct field counts but truncation prevents full verification; DiagnosticReasoning.tsx and FeatureImportance.tsx appear in modified list but show no content (unclear if removed or emptied); diseaseClassifier.ts also modified with no content shown. Backend truncation prevents verification of REQ-141. Overall, partial alignment is evident, but truncation prevents definitive assessment of completeness.",
