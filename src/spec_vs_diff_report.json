  "summary": "The diff implements most of the strict role-based data control and government workflow separation requirements. Key implementations include: GovernmentDataPanel with 15 fields and auto-calculated 7-day averages, LastGovernmentReport component with 9 read-only fields, EmailAlertService with placeholder credentials, AlertHistory with 14 columns, InterventionPriority with vulnerability weight formula, RiskPredictionPanel role-based simplification, and DashboardPage role-based rendering. However, some requirements are partially implemented or unverifiable due to diff truncation.",
