REQ-99 (remove Test Email Configuration button) appears to be implemented in GovernmentDataPanel.tsx (no test email button visible in the truncated code). REQ-100 (verify Update & Recalculate Risk button) shows partial implementation with form validation, risk calculation, component updates via custom events, and email alert triggering, but the diff is heavily truncated making full verification impossible.",
