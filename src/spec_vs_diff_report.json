  "summary": "The implementation successfully addresses all four requirements (REQ-116, REQ-117, REQ-118, REQ-119). DiseaseClassification.tsx now calculates disease probabilities dynamically using weighted formulas based on environmental parameters, includes an event listener for 'disease-classification-updated' events, normalizes probabilities to sum to 100%, and highlights the highest risk disease in red. GovernmentDataPanel.tsx dispatches the custom event after successful risk calculation with all environmental parameters. RiskPredictionPanel.tsx dispatches the same event after successful prediction. All acceptance criteria appear to be met based on the diff evidence.",
