  "summary": "This verification analyzes a comprehensive production-grade upgrade implementing role-based dashboard views, disease classification, 9-ward heatmap, priority scoring, alert history, EmailJS integration, and advanced visualizations. The diff shows substantial implementation of most requirements with high fidelity to specifications.",

      "reason": "Backend implementation creates fixed-size arrays using Array.repeat but the updateHistory function shifts values incorrectly - it reads from history[i-1] which would lose the oldest value without proper rotation. The implementation doesn't properly maintain a circular buffer of exactly 7 historical values.",
