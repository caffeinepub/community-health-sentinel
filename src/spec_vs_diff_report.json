  "summary": "The implementation addresses all three requirements: backend debugging and validation (REQ-102), comprehensive error handling in frontend (REQ-103), and integration to fix IC0508 canister rejection errors (REQ-101). The backend main.mo shows proper parameter handling, 7-day moving average calculations, weighted risk formula implementation, normalization, and error-free response structure. The frontend GovernmentDataPanel.tsx includes try-catch error handling, validation, and improved backend call structure. No hallucinated features detected.",
